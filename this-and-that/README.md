# `this` and that

## Getting Started
1. Complete exercise 1 located in the folder `ex1`
1. Complete exercise 2 located in the folder `ex2`

Once those are done, create a new folder called `stockCarVisual`

## Stock Car Visual (Final Boss)
You must create these files:
- an `index.html`
- a directory called `js` with a file `index.js`
- a directory called `css` with a file `styles.css`

Link up each resource file inside of your `index.html`. Declare a `window.onload` inside of your `index.js` file, all of your work will be done inside of this code block.

You will need your `stockCar` object from the final-boss section of the [Objects](https://gist.github.com/sgnl/688a2c95920d0d3d617c) exercise. Run the file in node or a REPL and copy and paste the output to a variable named `stockCar` in your JS file.

Your task is to Generate HTML content dynamically based on the data inside of your `stockCar` object. You cannot hard code the data! Your HTML code inside of the `<body` tags should be empty. Everything will be generated by your Javascript code.
